# What
The senate and senate exec committees still distribute their calendars as pdfs. This means every member must manually enter the dates into their calendars. 

This repository contains tools for making calendar files (currently, only .ics) from a .csv file containing the meetings.

# Instructions
Place the .csv file(s) you want to create the calendar file from in the 'input' folder. 

Run Executables/make_ics_file.py

A file called cal.ics will be created in the 'output' folder
